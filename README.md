# Discrete Kalman Filter for tracking an object tracking

Built on Ubuntu 20.04

This project aims to implement the Kalman Filter (Linear Quadratic Estimation) for Object-tracking in 1D and 2D in C++ using [this reference](https://machinelearningspace.com/object-tracking-python/)

Through this port, I got a brush up on using CMake and gained exposure to an amazing graph plotting library for C++, [Matplot++](https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus) along with the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) C++ library used for linear algebra and the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) C++ library used for image processing and computer vision techniques.

Please go through **ReadMe.md** in case you get stuck!
