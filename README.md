# Discrete Kalman Filter for tracking an object tracking

This project aims to implement the Kalman Filter (Linear Quadratic Estimation) for Object-tracking in 1D(complete), 2D (WIP) and 3D (WIP) in C++ using [this reference](https://machinelearningspace.com/object-tracking-python/)

Through this port, I got a brush up on using CMake and gained exposure to an amazing graph plotting library for C++, [Matplot++](https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus) along with the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) C++ library used for linear algebra.
